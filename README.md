# Kebab configurator

A Java application that simulates a kebab ordering experience, satisfying multiple food restriction needs.

Once the parameters have been selected, the configurator will show the perfect kebab for you!

The application's logic is built upon an [ontology](./app/src/main/resources/) realized in Protégé.
